Description:
Creation of portfolio webpage for Charles Boyle. Included is a header with name, profile picture and links (navigation) to projects, about me, contact and LinkedIn (all scroll or direct you to those places). There are 4 sections of the page within the body. The first is an about me, and the last 3 are different projects (Only 1 completed). The first image for the first project will direct a user to the deployed application when clicked on. At the bottom of the page is a contact me footer.

Creations made:
I used semantic html elements to break of the page accept for some divs within the main of the body. I added an h1 for the header to include my name and h2s for the sections within the main to indicate titles for projects. I either filled in paragraphs with information about me or used lorem to fill in areas that are not completed yet. I used font family, margin-top, color and font size to give the look and poisitioning for all text. The navigation bar was moved to the left with text align and each section clicked witll direct a user to that area/page. This was done with using either an href link within html or a # that combined with an id section of html to link the two together. 

The images selected were from my LInkedIn or images from the web. The profile picture selected was originally a square than I rounded off with border radius. The same changes were made to the Project 1 image, which also had a box shadow applied. The question mark images had the same changes made as well. The images all have descriptive alt text added to them within html as well. The background images for each section (header/body/project sections) were filled by uploading image to vs code within this project, renaming the image and then using the backgrond-image property within css for the desired area and then attached a url of the particular image name. 

I also used display-flex and flex-direction column for the main sections of the body and had a max width of each section of 800px for each section. The sections were made within a container in html and I used the gap property within html to set spaces between them. I also set a media query for when the screen shrinks to a particular size (576px x 910px). The backgrounds of the header and the body flip at this point.

I then added comments to CSS.


What I could not figure out:

I was unable to resize images with different sizes. When I changed one, they all changed to that size. I was unsure of how to make a class/id for a particular image.
